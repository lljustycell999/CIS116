/*
 * Project Description: You work for the US Coast Guard and you have been put in charge of a project to dispatch ships to
 * distress calls. You have decided to create a program that will determine how close your ships are to the
 * coordinates of the ship that is in trouble. Using coordinate data, calculate the distances of each of the
 * Coast Guard vessels from the distress call. Your program should also account for the maximum speed of each rescue vessel (you wouldn't send a
 * slow ship that is closest if a fast ship that is further away could get there first). Therefore, calculate the
 * time needed for each ship to travel the calculated distance. The program should ask for the name of the vessel, current date and time, number of people to be
 * rescued, and the position (via x and y coordinates). The program should display all of the user-entered
 * data along with a table of capacities, distances, and travel times for each Coast Guard vessel. Run your program to answer the following question. If there were 47 people to be rescued at location
 * 15x and 20y, how many of the ships would need to be sent (of the ones with the shortest travel time).
